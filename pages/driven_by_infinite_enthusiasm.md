	- ## Some math ✨
		- #lectures [Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLA58AC5CABC1321A3)
		- #book Artin - Algebra
		- [A Infinitely Large Napkin](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf)
		  id:: 63971467-7987-4f85-989d-47792d81d4a2
			- an introduction to a lots of fields of math! (NOT a textbook but a really nice book)
		- ### Differential geometry in $\mathbb{R}^3$ proper with introducing yourself *topology*
			- The lectures below has pre-requisites of basic topology and linear algebra, analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- #lectures [ICTP Diploma - Differential Geometry - Claudio Arezzo - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLq_gUfXAnkl5JArcktbOrIUeR5rra-Gz)
		- You can definitely do rigorous algebra and analysis at this point here, its always a inculcating and ever increasing skill and knowledge-base: ((24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f))
	- ## I DECREE: DO MORE CLASSICAL!
		- ### Fluid mechanics
			- If you think you know what fluid mechanics is (from school, say), I guarantee that you do not!
		- ### Special Relativistic Mechanics and Electrodynamics
			- #book LandauL volume II - absolute necessary for special relativity and electrodynamics, and GR
				- there’s no introduction to electrodynamics better than Paddy and LandauL
			- for more theory Griffiths, and for more pain: Jackson
			- TODO [[Electromagnetic_Circuitry]]
		- ### GR
			- > for properly doing GR, you’ll need a lot of pre-req, and its all super cool math! But for now a physics taste of the matter will just be smooth.
			- General Relativity and Cosmology by T Paddy
	- ## (only if you wanna do quantum)
		- Quantum Physics by Balki
		- Chapters 23-25 from ((63971467-7987-4f85-989d-47792d81d4a2))
	- ## Rigorous Constructions
	  id:: 24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f
	  > Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details
		- ### Construct spaces and do algebra and analysis
		  id:: 977695ee-4120-4536-b875-6fb25c4772e7
			- the idea is to *create* meaning, objects out of nothing..., even in familiar spaces
		- ### Inside dim $=1$ spaces
			- Tao Analysis vol I, II
			- Apostol Mathematical Analysis
			- Rudin Analysis (Baby Rudin)
		- ### Inside finite-dim $>1$ spaces
			- #### do more inside $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
				- ##### Algebra
					- Matrix algebra, tensor algebra, exterior algebra
				- ##### Analysis in $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
					- Total derivative of functions
					- Integrating: Differential forms
				- ##### Differential geometry of submanifolds of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- #### Analysis in finite-dim normed vector spaces
		- ### *Measure spaces* (measure theory)
		- > Go outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$: there are two routes: analysis on manifolds (classical mechanics, Hamiltonian systems) and analysis on function spaces (quantum mechanics, PDEs)
		- ### Inside (smooth) manifolds
			- #book Lee - Smooth manifolds
			- #book Boothby - manifolds
			- [[FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015]]
			- [[FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics]]
		- ### Inside infinite-dim spaces (Functional analysis)
	- ## apply your new-found knowledge
		- ### Dynamical systems
		- [[FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory]]
		- Ergodic theory
		- Use measure theory to do [Classical Equilibrium Statistical Mechanics](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/stefan_adams/lecturenotestvi/cdias-adams-30.pdf)
		- Probability
		- Hamiltonian systems and symplectic geometry
		- PDEs
	- ## more math ✨
		- [MathHistory: A course in the History of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316)
		- Category theory - *a new way to think about structures and spaces*
		- Algebraic Topology - *study of holes in topological spaces*
		- Differential topology
		- Graph theory
- # How to study?
	- ## How to do lectures?
		- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
			- Copy the lecture note
			- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
		- Make lecture notes
			- in Obsidian.
				- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
			- in physical notebook.
				- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
				- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
			- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
	- ## How to do books?
		- honestly I've no idea
- # more references, roadmaps
	- Look here:
		- [The fast track – Sheafification](http://sheafification.com/the-fast-track/)
		- [How to become a GOOD Theoretical Physicist (goodtheorist.science)](https://www.goodtheorist.science/)
		- ~~[20 prerequisites for Quantum Mechanics (Non-relativistic) (riddyrayes.github.io)](https://riddyrayes.github.io/notes/20-prerequisites-for-quantum-mechanics/)~~
		- #book Paddy - Theoretical Astrophysics volumes I, II & III
	- Watch (any one or all even) these one lecture and tell me how can you not love this!! (don’t pay attention to the name of the video)
