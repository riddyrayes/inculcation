# Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm
- Which lectures? (order is not strict)
	- [[Shifrin_Multivariable_Mathematics]]
	- ### Linear Algebra Done Right - Sheldon Axler
		- [Book website](https://linear.axler.net/), [Third ed pdf](http://library.lol/main/FA472BC434699EFE0F9BD5DC4E2E595E)
		- [YouTube lectures](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLGAnmvB9m7zOBVCZBUUmSinFV0wEir2Vw)
	- ### Classical Mechanics, bit of Statistical and Chaos
		- [[Driven by Infinite Enthusiasm.VBalki_Classical_Physics|Classical Physics by Balki]]
		- #book LandauL volume I
		- [Non-linear dynamics by Balki](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nh4TFzg30eQ&list=PLbMVogVj5nJQKk1E7OUQs_TcW_zQoaO4t)
		- (short) [Mechanics using the Action by T Paddy](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlFCvH2vR5kRzC1LQtHy_MUAquC-tQiiW)
	- ## Some math ✨
		- Abstract Algebra by Benedict Gross
		- Artin - Algebra
		- [A Infinitely Large Napkin](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf) - an introduction to a lots of fields of math! (NOT a textbook but a really nice book)
		- You can definitely do analysis here, its always a inculcating and ever increasing skill and knowledge-base: ((24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f))
	- ## I DECREE: DO MORE CLASSICAL!
		- ### Fluid mechanics
			- If you think you know what fluid mechanics is (from school, say), I guarantee that you do not!
		- ### Special Relativity and Electrodynamics
			- #book LandauL volume II - absolute necessary for special relativity and electrodynamics, and GR
				- there’s no introduction to electrodynamics better than Paddy and LandauL
			- for more theory Griffiths, and for more pain: Jackson
			- TODO [[Electromagnetic_Circuitry]]

		- GR
			- > for properly doing GR, you’ll need a lot of pre-req, and its all super cool math! But for now a physics taste of the matter will just be smooth.
			- General Relativity and Cosmology by T Paddy
	- more math ✨

	- ## Rigorous Constructions
	  id:: 24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f
	  > Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details
		- Construct spaces and do algebra and analysis
		  id:: 977695ee-4120-4536-b875-6fb25c4772e7
			- Tao Analysis vol I, II

			- Total derivative of functions
			- Differential forms
			- #lectures Differential Geometry by Claudio Arezzo
		- Go outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
			- < Manifold theory >
			- [[FredericSchuller-International Winter School on Gravity and Light 2015]]
			- [[FredericSchuller-Lectures on the Geometric Anatomy of Theoretical Physics]]
		- Expansion of analysis and beyond
			- Topology
			- Measure theory
				- Ergodic
					- [WARNING: Wolpertingers are known to nest in server racks.
					  Enter at your own risk.]
			- Functional analysis
	- Apply your new-found knowledge
		- [[FredericSchuller-Quantum Theory]]
		- Hamiltonian systems and symplectic geometry
- # How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
