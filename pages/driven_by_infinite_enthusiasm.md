		- Artin - Algebra
		- [A Infinitely Large Napkin](https://venhance.github.io/napkin/Napkin.pdf)
		  id:: 63971467-7987-4f85-989d-47792d81d4a2
			- an introduction to a lots of fields of math! (NOT a textbook but a really nice book)
		- You can definitely do analysis here, its always a inculcating and ever increasing skill and knowledge-base: ((24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f))
	- ## I DECREE: DO MORE CLASSICAL!
		- ### Fluid mechanics
			- If you think you know what fluid mechanics is (from school, say), I guarantee that you do not!
		- ### Special Relativity and Electrodynamics
			- #book LandauL volume II - absolute necessary for special relativity and electrodynamics, and GR
				- there’s no introduction to electrodynamics better than Paddy and LandauL
			- for more theory Griffiths, and for more pain: Jackson
			- TODO [[Electromagnetic_Circuitry]]
		- GR
			- > for properly doing GR, you’ll need a lot of pre-req, and its all super cool math! But for now a physics taste of the matter will just be smooth.
			- General Relativity and Cosmology by T Paddy
	- more math ✨
		- [MathHistory: A course in the History of Mathematics](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316)
		-
	- (only if you wanna do quantum)

	- ## Rigorous Constructions
	  id:: 24df46a2-7dbd-4e68-9d3b-6fcb4d02c62f
	  > Now that you see how deep things are, go back and focus on the details
		- Construct spaces and do algebra and analysis
		  id:: 977695ee-4120-4536-b875-6fb25c4772e7

		- PDEs
- # How to do lectures?
	- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
		- Copy the lecture note
		- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
	- Make lecture notes
		- in Obsidian.
			- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
		- in physical notebook.
			- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
			- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
		- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
