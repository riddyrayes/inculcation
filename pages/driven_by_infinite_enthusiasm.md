- ## start with the little things and the big things
	- ### little things: Groups (group theory, group actions)
		- One should start their journey with groups!

		- Philosophy of linear algebra I - finding happiness in small things
		  background-color:: blue
			- we see with just the little definition of a vector space, we can have things like **existence of a basis** using which we have ****
			- if you want more things, we can have more things! (oriented vector space, inner product spaces, normed vector spaces, etc.)
		- Philosophy of linear algebra II - giving lore being objects

		- Chapters 9-15 from ((63971467-7987-4f85-989d-47792d81d4a2))
		- Philosophy of linear algebra III - what is a vector?
		  background-color:: blue
			- a vector is an element of a vector space. no more no less. so you can add them and scale them. but they *belong* somewhere. closure of their operations is also just as important as the operations themselves.
				- now given a basis, lets say, we have a specific pov (coordinates) on the space
				- if we wanna change the basis, the pov (coordinate) changes
				- but that's just how we look at things! doesn't really effect the "sacred space"
				- this also implies that the transformation of the pov (coordinates) must follow certain rule (must be linear transformations) that **preserve the structure of the space**
					- because if we can add vectors, then the **addition of two vector is sacred**, they must not depend on the pov
			- if you want more characteristic to a vector, like length (or angles) between vectors, then you say the vector is an element of a normed vector space (or an inner product space)
				- again the change of pov must follow certain rule that **preserve the structure of the space**
					- because if we can measure lengths of vectors, then the **lengths are sacred too**, they must not depend on the pov
			- this philosophy is opposite to "a vector(or tensor) is a specified set of numbers that follows some given transformation rule" which definite works
		- Philosophy of linear algebra IV - thinking objects as part of a whole/constructing the whole first
		  background-color:: blue
			- the set of all linear maps from $V$ to $W$ (written as $\mathsf{Hom}(V,W$) *is made into a vector space* (as a subspace of the set of all functions between them, which is also a vector space)!
			- **anything is possible** (if it is constructable, and most things are)

				- #lecturenotes [diffgeo.pdf (ethz.ch)](https://people.math.ethz.ch/~salamon/PREPRINTS/diffgeo.pdf) One can distinguish extrinsic differential geometry and intrinsic differential geometry. The former restricts attention to submanifolds of Euclidean space while the latter studies manifolds equipped with a Riemannian metric. The extrinsic theory is more accessible because we can visualize curves and surfaces in $\mathbb{R}^{3}$ , but some topics can best be handled with the intrinsic theory. ...
	- ### *Measure spaces* (measure theory)
	- > Go outside of $\mathbb{R}^{n}$
		- there are two routes:
			- analysis on manifolds (classical mechanics, Hamiltonian systems)
			- analysis on function spaces (quantum mechanics, PDEs)
	- ### Out on (smooth) manifolds

	- ## How to do lectures?
		- Use https://obsidian.md to organize the amount of content/
			- Copy the lecture note
			- Complete each lecture and tick the check box.
		- Make lecture notes
			- in Obsidian.
				- you’ll need to learn LaTeX and probably will need a drawing tablet
			- in physical notebook.
				- Scan the lecture notes as PDF into one file and save it inside your vault.
				- Might seem/be a waste of time, but loosing hard worked lecture notes/not organizing them is a bigger loss.
			- Filling pages upon pages and never returning back onto them is NOT the process. Return to the notes, think, and solve your own questions.
