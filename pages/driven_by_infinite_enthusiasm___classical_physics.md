- ## Special Relativistic Mechanics and Electrodynamics
  > you can write the SIMPLEST action possible in a blank universe and DERIVE charged particle equation of motion and Maxwell-Heaviside equations (field equation of motion)
	- #book LandauL volume II - absolute necessary for special relativity and electrodynamics, and GR
		- there’s no introduction to electrodynamics better than Paddy and LandauL
	- for more theory (less pain) Griffiths, and for more pain: Jackson?
	- TODO [[Electromagnetic_Circuitry]] - practically no proper references, wanna do it problerly, seems it eventually leads to fluid(-like) equations
- ## Classical statistical mechanics
  > The main expectation from statistical mechanics is to derive all of thermodynamics with bare minimum assumptions from simple mechanics. But is this possible?
	- Balakrishnan talks about it in Classical Physics course, but does he do it? no.

	- [Lecture notes on Mathematical Statistical Mechanics (uni-tuebingen.de)](https://www.math.uni-tuebingen.de/de/forschung/maphy/lehre/ss-2019/statisticalphysics/dateien/lecture-notes.pdf) is a good one, talks about these things
	- MIT, and general pedagogy go exactly opposite to the main expectation
	- #book **Statistical Mechanics: From Thermodynamics to the Renormalization Group by James H. Luscombe** has a derivation of the combined first and second law of thermodynamics
	- ((63b91d41-a8a0-44c1-a82b-f7f9838ca04d))
	- Non-equilibrium StatMech has the **Boltzmann equation** which can be used to do a lot of stuff
- ## Fluid mechanics
  > why after electrodynamics? because this is crazy non-linear
	- If you think you know what fluid mechanics is (from school, say), I guarantee that you do not!
	- #lectures [Fluid Dynamics for Astrophysics - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=sS3atz1XdsI&list=PLlFCvH2vR5kSvwk53gINGDA9FyJbOX5kx)
		- only decent, maybe won't convince you, maybe the below videos would...

	- [Turbulent Flow is MORE Awesome Than Laminar Flow - YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5zI9sG3pjVU&t=842s)
- ## GR
  > for properly doing GR, you’ll need a lot of pre-req, and its all super cool math! But for now a physics taste of the matter will just be smooth.
