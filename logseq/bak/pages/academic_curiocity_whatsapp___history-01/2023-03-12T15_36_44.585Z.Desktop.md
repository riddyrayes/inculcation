  26/11/22, 2:52 am - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): What is the backfire effect
  
  The backfire effect is a cognitive bias that causes people who encounter evidence that challenges their beliefs to reject that evidence, and to strengthen their support of their original stance. Essentially, the backfire effect means that showing people evidence which proves that they are wrong is often ineffective, and can actually end up backfiring, by causing them to support their original stance more strongly than they previously did.
  
  As such, the backfire effect is a subtype of the confirmation bias, which is a cognitive bias that can cause people to reject information which contradicts their beliefs, or to interpret information in a way that confirms those beliefs.

  26/11/22, 1:11 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): Overview of a Two-Step Workflow
  At a high level, my learning workflow consists of two primary phases:
  
  Context-Based Note-Taking
  Long-Term Knowledge Management
  Context-based note-taking represents the traditional approach of taking and separating notes based on the context or class (e.g., lecture and reading notes). This type of note-taking is optimized for the rapid collection of information (bullet points, sketches) presented in fluid environments (lectures, readings) with clear goals, outcomes, and contexts (passing a class, reading a book). This step is facilitated through the traditional tools of note-taking: paper and pen or similar electronic alternatives.
  
  Long-term knowledge management represents a distinct phase focused on extracting notes from their specific context and merging them to create a knowledge database that can be used for years to come. This type of note-taking is optimized for deliberate weighing of information and relationships (connecting notes, creating flashcards) in a controlled environment (Obsidian, Notion) with potentially unclear goals, outcomes, and contexts (future research project, long-term storage).
  
  While the division between the two phases is fluid, I've found it helpful to keep the two as separate as possible. This separation doesn't imply that you should always store them in different places—it's often beneficial to keep them all in one location. Instead, it emphasizes the need to recognize which phase you're are currently in.
  
  Reasons for a Two-Phase Process
  If context-based note-taking represents most of the traditional note-taking approaches, why should there be additional work to add the second phase? To use a great analogy from The Art of Doing Science and Engineering, the practice of studying and note-taking is just an intellectual investment with compound interest—the longer you can maintain the knowledge and build complex relationships, the greater the return on value. Stopping at context-based note-taking means cashing out on your intellectual investment at the end of each term, while continuing with long-term knowledge management means letting your intellectual investments grow through the course of your studies (and hopefully beyond).
  
  Additionally, by adding in a second processing phase, you can address a common mistake of copying, but not understanding ideas. By taking the extra step of extracting the note, you have the chance to interrogate whether you truly understand the idea by 1) rewriting it into your own words and format (similar to the Feynman Technique) and 2) integrating the information with past experiences.

  26/11/22, 1:12 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): Context-Based Note-Taking
  As mentioned in the overview above, context-based note-taking encompasses most familiar note-taking processes. Choosing the right tools techniques in this domain is often dependent on the learning environment and the individual. Therefore, there are many different ways of approaching this step, so make sure to think critically about what tools methods work best for you!
  
  Basic Note-Taking Approach
  I primarily use an iPad and Apple Pencil to take notes by hand in GoodNotes. As a bioengineering student, the content I worked with ranged from biological facts to diagrams, mathematical expressions, and chemical formulae. As a result, my context-based note-taking system prioritized flexibility and speed, a domain where handwriting excels.
  
  Figure 2: Example Page of Lecture Notes
  goodnotes-note-example.png
  
  As the bedrock of my context-based note-taking process, these notes are primarily focused on capturing important information to be successful in a class or project. Notes are separated by class (See Figure 1) so that it was easy to quickly separate and access all of the information associated with a specific context. Initially, these notes would serve as the studying material for the class, but once I start processing them for long-term knowledge management, I would generally refer to these notes only if there was something context-specific that I need to look into (e.g., set of practice problems).
  
  At this stage, I'm not focusing on processing or relating my notes directly to others. This extra processing step can impede the rapid capture of information—I can complete the processing later more deliberately and comprehensively. However, I still make quick notations (in an easily-identifiable manner) to remind myself to go back, such as the pink annotation in Figure 2.

  Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems
  In reality, there is no magnetic monopole – the north and south poles of a magnet are usually assumed to be inseparable. However, a magnetic monopole can occur in certain magnetic solids, as researchers at the Max Planck Institute for the Physics of Complex Systems have discovered. Such a solid represents a complex system in which the whole is more than the sum of its parts – this is why even a magnetic monopole can occur. The physicists develop theories regarding such phenomena: not only in solids, but also in individual atoms, molecules or in small groups of atoms, where they interact with light, for example. They also want to understand the physical principles behind cell division or the transport system in biological cells. As different as these systems are, their complex behaviour is largely based on the same principles.

  25/01/23, 2:49 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): The current implementation of the Neo-Darwinian model of evolution typically assumes that the set of possible phenotypes is organized into a highly symmetric and regular space equipped with a notion of distance, for example, a Euclidean vector space. Recent computational work on a biophysical genotype–phenotype model based on the folding of RNA sequences into secondary structures suggests a rather different picture. If phenotypes are organized according to genetic accessibility, the resulting space lacks a metric and is formalized by an unfamiliar structure, known as a pre-topology.  ...

  21/02/23, 2:06 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): Dear all,
  
   Everyone is invited to the next talk of the Graduate students' group seminar, whose details are as follows:
  
  Speaker: Ravi Tomar
  
  Title: An Introduction to Relatively Hyperbolic Groups
  
  Abstract: In his seminal work, Gromov revolutionized the theory of infinite groups by treating groups as geometric objects. In the same article, he introduced the notion of hyperbolic and relatively hyperbolic groups. Over the last three decades these groups have received a tremendous amount of attention and many of their properties have been understood. In this talk, I will introduce the notion of relatively hyperbolic groups and discuss some properties of them.
  
  Date: 23rd February 2023 (Thursday).
  Time: 5 PM.
  Venue: AB2 2A or 2B.
  
  Feel free to ask questions to the speaker between and after the talk.

  04/03/23, 5:48 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): but that shouldn't have affected the curiosity but anyways🥹
  04/03/23, 5:49 pm - Samanway is now a community admin
  04/03/23, 5:50 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): Aaaaand I welcome @Samanway as a co-admin of Academic Curiosity! He's a math major in IISc and we banter pretty well😏
  04/03/23, 5:57 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): quoted from him _This (Academic Curiosity) is more like “Rupadarshi forces his idle musings down your throat”_
  
  and the policy is simple, if you see this channel cluttering your WhatsApp, then just leave, if this isn't fun, i won't mind at all, doesn't matter if you're a friend/stanger/others

  a little info about the groups in this community:
  
  ONLYmeth - a random math people coming together group
  
  study-not a simple-group - me condescending on physics majors
  
  you can request to join any of these groups.
  
  the other groups are private ;)

  09/03/23, 10:24 am - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): I once devised a set of (physical-looking, modification of Newtonian ones) axioms that can be used to construct a vector space structure of Newtonian space-time for someone who is learning linear algebra 101. It gives you the usual outcome of having some inertial frames, Galilean transformations between them, ma = F, rules for F etc.
  
  this was (probably? and if yes, obviously) a naive structure to use for Newtonian space-time even, a very natural thing to use is a smooth manifold structure
  
  https://youtu.be/IBlCu1zgD4Y (dont worry about the title of the video)
  
  here, in proper philosophy of the structure, there are _no_ inertial/non inertial frames, something called a connection ∇ (for covariant derivative) takes care of whatever "frame" we are using, (context: acceleration a = ∇v)
  
  i think this is what is done in the first chapters of Arnold's mathematical methods book?
  
  i sense similar thing happens in SR too, where the whole thing is different, but coordinate free philosophy of manifolds makes it ❤️, GR takes it to the next level 
  
  to learn GR/manifold theory and/or more, I'll recommend just blindly starting this https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLMsYJgjgZE8hh6d6ia2dP1NI0BKNRXbiw (or anything by the same instructor F Schuller, there's a mechanics course in German which i wanna do lmao) 
  and not wasting your time on physics books 🙂😉
  
  remember philosophy of doing things is important that's what makes us different from engineers (the lectures instructor emphasizes the philosophy every single time, in the above course)
  
  if you don't want to do this and take your time Padmanabhan GR is always there, other than the books which try to make the simple theory of manifolds "simpler"

- 10/03/23, 1:25 pm - Rupadarshi(tryin/th best): On seminars:
  
  Older graduate students will verify that there is a high correlation between those students who are doing the broadest and deepest work and those who are regularly attending seminars. Many people erroneously conclude that those who are the strongest students therefore go to seminars, while in fact the causation goes very much in the opposite direction.
  Go to research seminars earlier than you think you should. Do not just go to seminars that you think are directly related to what you do (or more precisely, what you currently think you currently do). You should certainly go to every single seminar related to algebraic geometry that you can, and likely drop by other seminars occasionally too. Learning to get information out of research seminars is an acquired skill, usually acquired much later than the skill of reading mathematics. You may think it isn't helpful to go to a seminar where you understand just 5% of what the speaker says, and may want to wait until you are closer to 100%; but no one is anywhere near 100% (even the speaker!), so you should go anyway.
  Try to follow the thread of the talk, and when you get thrown, try to get back on again. (This isn't always possible, and admittedly often the fault lies with the speaker.)
  At the end of the talk, you should try to answer the questions: What question(s) is the speaker trying to answer? Why should we care about them? What flavor of results has the speaker proved? Do I have a small example of the phenonenon under discussion? You can even scribble down these questions at the start of the talk, and jot down answers to them during the talk.
  Try to extract three words from the talk (no matter how tangentially related to the subject at hand) that you want to know the definition of. Then after the talk, ask me what they mean. (In general, feel free to touch base with me after every seminar. I might tell you something interesting related to the talk.)
  New version of the previous jot: try the "three things" exercise.
  See if you can get one lesson from the talk (broadly interpreted). If you manage to get one lesson from each talk you go to, you'll learn a huge amount over time, although you'll only realize this after quite a while. (If you are unable to learn even one thing about mathematics from a talk, think about what the speaker could have done differently so that you could have learned something. You can learn a lot about giving good talks by thinking about what makes bad talks bad.)
  Try to ask one question at as many seminars as possible, either during the talk, or privately afterwards. The act of trying to formulating an interesting question (for you, not the speaker!) is a worthwhile exercise, and can focus the mind.
  Here's a phenomenon I was surprised to find: you'll go to talks, and hear various words, whose definitions you're not so sure about. At some point you'll be able to make a sentence using those words; you won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the sentence is correct. You'll also be able to ask a question using those words. You still won't know what the words mean, but you'll know the question is interesting, and you'll want to know the answer. Then later on, you'll learn what the words mean more precisely, and your sense of how they fit together will make that learning much easier. The reason for this phenomenon is that mathematics is so rich and infinite that it is impossible to learn it systematically, and if you wait to master one topic before moving on to the next, you'll never get anywhere. Instead, you'll have tendrils of knowledge extending far from your comfort zone. Then you can later backfill from these tendrils, and extend your comfort zone; this is much easier to do than learning "forwards". (Caution: this backfilling is necessary. There can be a temptation to learn lots of fancy words and to use them in fancy sentences without being able to say precisely what you mean. You should feel free to do that, but you should always feel a pang of guilt when you do.)
  Your thesis problem may well come out of an idea you have while sitting in a seminar.
